# PatchGuardResearch
Bypassing kernel patch protection runtime.

As I wrote in the article. This is a dynamic PatchGuars bypass for Windows 10 Pro 22H2. I admit that MS have done a great job but PatchGuard has been defeated once again and as per of my lab tests. The majority of AV's did not detected the bypass.

Tools used:

[+] WinDgb Preview with KDNET

[+] HEX DEREF PRO

Skill requirement:

[+] Advanced
